# @deshaw/jupyterlab-pyflyby

A labextension to integrate pyflyby with notebooks.

[Pyflyby](https://github.com/deshaw/pyflyby) helps you get rid of the tedious task of recalling and adding import statements. This labextension takes it further by adding the import statements automatically in your notebook. For eg. executing `np.arange(10)`

You can decide cell where imports should be added by adding 'pyflyby-cell' cell tag to it.
